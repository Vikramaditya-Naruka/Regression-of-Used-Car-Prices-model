Car Price Prediction Model

This model is designed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features like year, mileage, make, model, engine size, and more. By analyzing these attributes, the model learns patterns in the data to estimate the price of a car.

The steps involved include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Selecting important features that contribute to the price prediction, like car age, mileage, or brand.
Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost or Random Forest to learn from historical data.
Prediction: Applying the trained model to new, unseen data to predict car prices.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure accurate predictions.
